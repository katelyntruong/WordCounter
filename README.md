# WordCounter
This program would print out words from the input text as well as their frequencies. This would help web search engine determine the most relevant documents to the query based on the similarity of word counts (relative to the document size), which also known as TF/DF algorithm. 

In this project, I used Hash Table to excecute the input. It would print out words'occurences and some other properties. Instruction details is described in P3.pdf.
